## Running expy
Requirements can be found in `tools/requirements.txt`, and can be installed by running `pip install -r tools/requirements.txt`

However it is highly recommended to use venv to develop and run expy. 

A bash script has been made to setup the virtual environment on linux and install the requirements, simply run `source tools/_setup_venv.sh` from the home directory.
